### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is **on-demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources

Cloud services (usually) uses **pay-as-you-go pricing** model.

You can **provision exactly the right type and size of computing** resources you need. 

**Simple way to access** servers, storage, databases and applications


### The Deployment Models of Cloud Computing

1. Private Cloud
   - used by single organisation
   - complete control
   - security for sensitive applications and data
   - meet specific business needs

2. Public Cloud
   - resources owned and operated by third-party cloud service provider 
   - it has **six advantages** mentioned below
   - top three public cloud service providers: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud

3. Hybrid Cloud
   - keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
   - control over sensitive assets in the private infrastructure 
   - flexibility and cost-effectiveness of public cloud


### The 5 characteristics of Cloud Computing 

1. On-demand and self-service
2. Broad network access
   - resources are available on the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
   - multiple users share infrastructure with security and privacy
   - multiple users share the same physical resources
4. Rapid elasticity and scalability 
5. Measured service
   - pay exactly what you used 


### The 6 advantages of Public Cloud Computing

1. Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
   - pay on-demand: don't own hardware
   - reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) & operational expense (opex)
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
   - prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
3. Stop guessing capacity 
   - scale based on actual measured usage
4. Increase speed and agility 
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes


### Problems solved by the Cloud

1. Flexibility: change resource types when needed
2. Cost-effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
3. Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
4. Elasticity: ability to scale-out and scale-in when needed
5. High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across global data-centers 
6. Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
