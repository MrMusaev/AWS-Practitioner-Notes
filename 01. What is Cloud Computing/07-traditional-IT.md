### Intro

Basic principle of how websites work: client -> network -> server

Servers are composed:
- Compute (CPU)
- Memory (RAM)
- Storage (Permanent Storage)
- Database - to store data in a structured way
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server


### IT Terminology

- Network - cables, routers and servers connected with each other
- Router - device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They identify where to send your packages on the Internet
- Switch - takes a packet and sends it to the correct client/server

Client -> router -> switch -> other clients or servers

### Problems with traditional IT servers

- Pay for the rent
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance,
- Scaling is limited
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure 
- Dealing with disasters (earthquake, power shutdown, fire...)
